# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of data on the *number of interactions with marine turtles, seabirds, mobulid rays, cetaceans and whale sharks*. CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting whale sharks (_Rhincodon typus_) are encouraged to provide the data although they are exempt from reporting  (Res. [13/05](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1305-conservation-whale-sharks-rhincodon-typus)). CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting cetaceans are encouraged to provide the information to the Secretariat (Res. [23/06](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2306-conservation-cetaceans)). For each stratum, the data coverage -- i.e., the percentage (%) of occurrences of interactions sampled -- derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

# Referenced codelists

## Administrative and geospatial domains

### Countries (ADM.COU) {#countries}

Reference codes modeling the flag / reporting country submitting a dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COUNTRIES, "COUNTRIES")
```

### IOTC main areas (GIS.IOTC.MA) {#IOTCareasMain}

Reference codes modeling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area, *roughly* coinciding with FAO areas F51 and F57).

![](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/content/IOTC_AREA_OF_COMPETENCE_ENG.png)

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
```

## Fisheries and fishing technologies domains

### Fisheries (FIS) {#fisheries}

An *ad-hoc* classification derived from a combination of several factors (purpose, area of operation, vessel size category, gear, gear configuration, fishing mode and target species) that uniquely describe fishing practices for groups of vessels.

An [*interactive wizard*](https://data.iotc.org/fisheries/wizard) to help CPCs identify the IOTC code for their fisheries (among those currently considered of relevance in the Indian Ocean).

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(FISHERIES, "FISHERIES")
```

## Data and metadata domains

### Data types (DTA.TY) {#types}

Reference codes modeling the type of statistics provided through a specific form, and in particular if these are:

a)    preliminary if the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or
b)    final if the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")
```

### Coverage types (DTA.COV.TY) {#coverageTypes}

Reference codes modeling the type of coverage for the raw information used to obtain the data provided through a specific form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COVERAGE_TYPES, "COVERAGE_TYPES")
```
