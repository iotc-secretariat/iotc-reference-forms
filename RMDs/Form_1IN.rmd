# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of data on fisheries interactions with marine turtles, seabirds, mobulid rays, cetaceans, and whale sharks. CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting whale sharks (_Rhincodon typus_) are encouraged to provide the data although they are exempt from reporting (Res. [13/05](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1305-conservation-whale-sharks-rhincodon-typus)). CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting cetaceans are encouraged to provide the information to the Secretariat (Res. [23/06](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2306-conservation-cetaceans)). For each stratum, the data type and coverage (percentage; %) are essential to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

# Data content

Number of interactions along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by year, fleet, fishery, and IOTC main area.

# Reporting deadlines

- **Longline fisheries**: 30 June (preliminary), 30 December (final)
- **Surface fisheries**: 30 June (final)

# Reference codelists

## Entities {#entities}

Reference codes modelling the entity submitting the dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(ENTITIES, "ENTITIES")
```

## Countries {#countries}

Reference codes modelling the flag / reporting country submitting the dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COUNTRIES, "COUNTRIES")
```

## IOTC main areas {#IOTCareasMain}

Reference codes modelling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area, *roughly* coinciding with FAO areas F51 and F57).

![](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/content/IOTC_AREA_OF_COMPETENCE_ENG.png)

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
```

## Fisheries {#fisheries}

An *ad-hoc* classification derived from a combination of several factors (purpose, area of operation, vessel size category, gear, gear configuration, fishing mode and target species) that uniquely describe fishing practices for groups of vessels.

An [*interactive wizard*](https://data.iotc.org/fisheries/wizard) to help CPCs identify the IOTC code for their fisheries (among those currently considered of relevance in the Indian Ocean).

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(FISHERIES, "FISHERIES")
```

## Data types {#types}

Reference codes modelling the type of statistics provided through a specific form, and in particular if these are:

a. Preliminary if the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or

b. Final if the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")
```

## Coverage types {#coverageTypes}

Reference codes modelling the type of coverage for the raw information used to obtain the data provided through a specific form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COVERAGE_TYPES, "COVERAGE_TYPES")
```
