# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of *annual estimates of the numbers of interactions* of [longline fisheries](#iotclonglinefishery) and [surface fisheries](#iotcsurfacefishery) with endangered, threatened, and protected species by fishing fleet, fishery, IOTC main area, and species group for a given CPC / fleet.

- Species group: marine turtles, seabirds, mobulid rays, cetaceans, and whale sharks

# Reporting deadlines

-   **Longline fisheries**: 30 June (preliminary), 30 December (final)
-   **Surface fisheries**: 30 June (final)

# Stratification

## Main data fields

-   [Fishery](#fisheries)
- [IOTC main areas](../domain/admin/#IOareasMain)


## Additional Data fields

-   [Data types](#dataTypes)

# Referenced codelists

## Administrative and geospatial domains

### Countries (ADM.COU) {#countries}

Reference codes modeling the flag / reporting country submitting a dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COUNTRIES, "COUNTRIES")
```

### IOTC main areas (GIS.IOTC.MA) {#IOTCareasMain}

Reference codes modeling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area, *roughly* coinciding with FAO areas F51 and F57).

![](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/content/IOTC_AREA_OF_COMPETENCE_ENG.png)

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
```

## Fisheries and fishing technologies domains

### Fisheries (FIS) {#fisheries}

An *ad-hoc* classification derived from a combination of several factors (purpose, area of operation, vessel size category, gear, gear configuration, fishing mode and target species) that uniquely describe fishing practices for groups of vessels.

An [*interactive wizard*](https://data.iotc.org/fisheries/wizard) to help CPCs identify the IOTC code for their fisheries (among those currently considered of relevance in the Indian Ocean).

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(FISHERIES, "FISHERIES")
```

## Data and metadata domains

### Data types (DTA.TY) {#dataTypes}

Reference codes modeling the type of data provided through a specific form (preliminary / final / unknown).

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")
```

### Coverage types (DTA.COV.TY) {#coverageTypes}

Reference codes modeling the type of coverage for the raw information used to obtain the data provided through a specific form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COVERAGE_TYPES, "COVERAGE_TYPES")
```
