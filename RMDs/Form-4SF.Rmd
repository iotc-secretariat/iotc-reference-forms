# Description

This form provides for the monthly reporting of size-frequency estimates for IOTC species, as well as common sharks and other bycatch species caught in association with IOTC fisheries. The form allows reporting data for multiple fisheries and species simultaneously.

Click [here](../forms/Form-4SF.xlsx) to download a blank version of Form 4-SF, or [return](../forms) to the list of all IOTC statistical data reporting forms. Click [here](../forms/Form-4SF-update.xlsx) to download a blank version of Form 4-SF-update which has been designed to report updated data for a single fishery and species.

# Data content

Numbers of fish sampled and raised by size category and species, along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by month, year, fleet, fishery, and geographical grid.
