# Description

This form supports the reporting of estimates of discards in numbers or live weight equivalent for the IOTC species, mobulid rays, whale sharks, cetaceans, common sharks, and other bycatch species. Reporting of quarterly estimates is voluntary and recommended to assess the seasonality of the discards. For each stratum, the data coverage – i.e., the percentage (%) of amount of fish sampled – derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

<!-- The term annual catches refers to highly aggregated statistics for each species estimated per fleet, gear, year, and main IOTC Area. Discards refer to the part of the catch that is not retained on board, expressed in number and/or live weight. It includes: -->
<!--     + The catches of specimens that are discarded dead due to them not having commercial value: non-commercial species, fish of small size, fish in poor condition, etc. -->
<!--     + The catches of specimens that are discarded dead due to other reasons: not enough storage on board, gear breakdown, etc. -->
    
<!-- The recommended minima levels of coverage for catch data are specified in IOTC Resolution 22/04 (Regional Observer Scheme). -->

<!-- Appendix I and Appendix II contain more information about these requirements. -->

# Data content

Total number or live weight of discarded catches by species, along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by quarter if available, year, fleet, fishery, discard reason, and IOTC main area.

<!-- # Standards -->

<!-- The standards for reporting annual discards to the IOTC are defined in IOTC Res. [15/02](). In addition, other IOTC resolutions include specific requirements for the reporting of data on total catches from the fisheries, including requirements for sharks (Res. [13/06](), [12/09](), [13/05]()), seabirds (Res. [10/06]()), marine turtles (Res. [12/04]()), and cetaceans (Res. [13/04]()). -->

These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_SPECIES, "LEGACY_SPECIES")
```

## Discard reasons {#legacydiscardreason}

Reference codes modelling the discard reasons information used to obtain the data provided through a specific form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_FATES[DATASET_CODE == "DI"], "LFATES")
```

## Discard conditions {#legacydiscardconditions}

Reference codes modelling the conditions (at capture / at release) of individual aquatic creatures being discarded at sea or measured.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(INDIVIDUAL_CONDITIONS, "INDIVIDUAL_CONDITIONS")
```


## Data types {#Legacytypes}

a. Preliminary when the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or

b. Final when the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_DATA_TYPES, "LEGACY_DATA_TYPES")
```

## Retained catches data sources {#LegacydataSourcesRC}

```

## Retained catches data processings {#legacydataProcessingsRC}

Reference codes modelling the processing applied to the retained catch data.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_PROCESSINGS[DATASET_CODE == "RC"], "LDATA_PROCESSINGS_RC")
```

## Coverage types {#legacycoverageTypes}

Reference codes modelling the type of coverage for the raw information used to obtain the retained catch data.
