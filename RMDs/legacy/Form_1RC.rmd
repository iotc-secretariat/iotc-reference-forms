# Definition

: The term Annual catches refers to highly aggregated statistics for each species estimated per fleet, gear and year for a large area (IOTC Area). These include:
•	Retained catches: Refers to the part of the catch that is retained on board, expressed in live weight; it includes:
o	Catches of specimens of the target species, which are usually stored on the main vessel compartments and sold in the local market or other international markets. 
o	Retained bycatch, which refers to the incidental catches of specimens of species that are not the target of the fishery but are of commercial value or to the catches of specimens of the target species having poor quality (e.g. undersized, spoiled, etc.).  Retained bycatch specimens are usually stored on separate compartments onboard and sold in the local markets or used for direct consumption. 
•	Discards: Refers to the part of the bycatch that is not retained on board, expressed in number and/or live weight. It includes:
o	The catches of specimens that are discarded dead due to them not having commercial value: non-commercial species, fish of small size, fish in poor condition, etc.
o	The catches of specimens that are discarded dead due to other reasons: not enough storage on board, gear breakdown, etc.
STANDARDS FOR THE REPORTING OF ANNUAL CATCHES: The standards for the reporting of annual catches to the IOTC are defined in IOTC Resolution 10/02; in addition, other IOTC resolutions include specific requirements for the reporting of data on total catches from the fisheries, including requirements for sharks (05/05, 13/06, 12/09, 13/05), seabirds (05/09, 10/06), marine turtles (12/04), and Cetaceans (13/04). The recommended minima levels of coverage for catch data are specified in IOTC Resolution 11/04 (Regional Observer Scheme). Appendix I and Appendix II contain more information about these requirements.

These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(SPECIES, "SPECIES")
```

## Reasons for retaining {#retainReasons}

Reference codes modelling the reasons why marine organisms caught by the fishery are retained onboard.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(RETAIN_REASONS, "RETAIN_REASONS")
```

## Data types {#types}

Reference codes modelling the type of statistics provided through a specific form, and in particular if these are:

a. Preliminary when the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or

b. Final when the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")
```
