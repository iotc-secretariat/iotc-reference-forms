# Definition

This form supports the reporting of estimates of retained catches in live weight equivalent (metric tonnes; t) for the IOTC species, common sharks, and other bycatch species. Reporting of quarterly estimates is voluntary and recommended to assess seasonality of the retained catches. For each stratum, the data coverage – i.e., the percentage (%) of amount of fish sampled – derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

# Data content

Total live weight of retained catches by species, along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by  quarter if available, year, fleet, fishery and IOTC main area.

# Reference code lists

## Fleet {#LEGACY_FLEETS}

Reference codes modelling the flag / reporting country submitting the dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_FLEETS, "LEGACY_FLEETS")
```

## IOTC main areas {#IOTCareasMain}

Reference codes modelling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area).

![](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/content/IOTC_AREA_OF_COMPETENCE_ENG.png)

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
```

## Fisheries {#LEGACY_FISHERIES}

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_FISHERIES, "LEGACY_FISHERIES")
```

## Species {#LEGACY_SPECIES }

Reference codes modelling the species interacting with the fisheries as:

-   target species (retained or discarded)
-   bycatch species (retained or discarded)
-   sampled individuals
-   etc.

These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_SPECIES, "LEGACY_SPECIES")
```

## Data types {#legacytypes}

Reference codes modelling the type of statistics provided through a specific form, and in particular if these are:

a. Preliminary when the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or

b. Final when the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_DATA_TYPES, "LEGACY_DATA_TYPES")
```

## Retained catches data sources {#LegacydataSourcesRC}

Reference codes modelling the source of the data provided through the retained catches data form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_SOURCES[DATASET_CODE == "RC"] , "LDATA_SOURCES_RC")
```

## Retained catches data processings {#legacydataProcessingsRC}

Reference codes modelling the processing applied to the data provided through the retained catches data form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_PROCESSINGS[DATASET_CODE == "RC"], "LDATA_PROCESSINGS_RC")
```

## Coverage types {#LegacycoverageTypes}

Reference codes modelling the type of coverage for the raw information used to obtain the data provided through a specific form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(LEGACY_COVERAGE, "LCOVERAGE_TYPES")
```
