# Description
  
This form provides for the reporting of data on fisheries interactions with marine turtles, seabirds, mobulid rays, cetaceans, and whale sharks. CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting whale sharks (_Rhincodon typus_) are encouraged to provide the data although they are exempt from reporting (Res. [13/05](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-1305-conservation-whale-sharks-rhincodon-typus)). CPCs having national and state legislation for protecting cetaceans are encouraged to provide the information to the Secretariat (Res. [23/06](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2306-conservation-cetaceans)). For each stratum, the types of data and coverage (percentage; %) are essential to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.
