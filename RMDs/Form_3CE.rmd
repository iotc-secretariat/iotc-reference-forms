# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of *Estimates of species-specific catches and efforts by fishing fleet, fishery, and space and time strata* for a given CPC / fleet.

This form supports the reporting of estimates of geo-referenced of species-specific catches and efforts by fishing fleet, fishery, and space and time strata, _as initial submission for all fisheries of a CPC in June_.

-   sampled individuals
-   etc.

These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(SPECIES, "SPECIES")
```

### Reasons for retaining (SPC.FTE.RE) {#retainReasons}

Reference codes that model the reasons why aquatic creatures caught by the fishery are retained onboard.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(RETAIN_REASONS, "RETAIN_REASONS")
```

## Data and metadata domains

Reference codes modeling the type of statistics provided through a specific form, and in particular if these are:

a)    preliminary if the statistics were estimated by using some information from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are likely to change in the future as more information become available; or
b)    final if the statistics were estimated by using the complete set of data from the fishery and year concerned, and the data reported are unlikely to change in the future.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(DATA_SOURCES_CE, "DATA_SOURCES_CE")

Reference codes that model the units used to report the level of effort, further stratified by the specific criteria characterizing each reporting form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(EFFORT_UNITS, "EFFORT_UNITSS")
