# Description
  
This form provides for the reporting of estimates of discards in numbers or live weight equivalent for the IOTC species, mobulid rays, whale sharks, cetaceans, common sharks, and other bycatch species. Reporting of quarterly estimates is voluntary and recommended to assess the seasonality of the discards. For each stratum, the data coverage -- i.e., the percentage (%) of amount of fish sampled -- derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

Click [here](../forms/Form-1DI.xlsx) to download a blank version of Form 1-DI, or [return](../forms) to the list of all IOTC statistical data reporting forms.

# Data content

Number or live weight of discards by species, including their condition at release, if the data are raised, along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by  quarter if available, year, fleet, fishery, and IOTC main area.
