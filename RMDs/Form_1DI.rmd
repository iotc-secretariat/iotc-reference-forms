# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of _estimates of discards in numbers or live weight equivalent for the IOTC species, mobulid rays, whale sharks, cetaceans, common sharks, and other bycatch species_. Reporting of quarterly estimates is voluntary and recommended to assess the seasonality of the discards. For each stratum, the data coverage -- i.e., the percentage (%) of amount of fish sampled -- derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

Click [here](../forms/Form-1DI.xlsx) to download an empty version of Form 1DI, or [return](../forms) to the list of all new versions of the IOTC statistical data reporting forms.

# Reporting deadlines

## Additional information

Total annual estimates of the amount of fish caught and discarded by fishing fleet, fishery, IOTC main area, species, and condition.

# Referenced codelists

## Countries (ADM.COU) {#countries}

Reference codes modelling the flag / reporting country submitting this dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(COUNTRIES, "COUNTRIES")
```

## IOTC main areas (GIS.IOTC.MA) {#IOTCareasMain}

Reference codes modelling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area, _roughly_ coinciding with FAO areas F51 and F57).

```{r collapse = TRUE}
out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
```

## Fisheries (FIS) {#fisheries}

An _ad-hoc_ classification derived from a combination of several factors (purpose, area of operation, vessel size category, gear, gear configuration, fishing mode and target species) that uniquely describe fishing practices for groups of vessels.

An [_interactive wizard_](https://data.iotc.org/fisheries/wizard) to help CPCs identify the IOTC code for  their fisheries (among those currently considered of relevance in the Indian Ocean).

```{r collapse = TRUE}

### Catch units (FIA.CU) {#catchUnits}

Reference codes modelling the units used to report the level of catches / discards of a given species, further stratified by the specific criteria characterizing each reporting form.

```{r collapse = TRUE}

+ sampled individuals
+ etc.

These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org
) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.

## Individual conditions (SPC.CN) {#individualConditions}

Reference codes modelling the conditions (at capture / at release) of individual aquatic creatures being discarded at sea or measured.
