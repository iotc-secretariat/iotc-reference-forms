# Description
  
This form supports the reporting of _estimates of total annual discard levels in live weight (or number)_ for a given CPC / fleet.

Data should be provided already raised to annual / quarterly totals by the source.

          # Referenced codelists
          
          ## Administrative and geospatial domains
          
          ### Countries (ADM.COU) {#countries}
          
          Reference codes modeling the flag / reporting country submitting a dataset to the IOTC Secretariat.
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(COUNTRIES, "COUNTRIES")
          ```
          
          ### IOTC main areas (GIS.IOTC.MA) {#IOTCareasMain}
          
          Reference codes modeling the two main areas in which the IOTC area of competence is split (western / eastern IOTC area, _roughly_ coinciding with FAO areas F51 and F57).
          
          ![](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/content/IOTC_AREA_OF_COMPETENCE_ENG.png)
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(IOTC_MAIN_AREAS, "IOTC_MAIN_AREAS")
          ```
          
          ## Fisheries and fishing technologies domains
          
          ### Fisheries (FIS) {#fisheries}
          
          An _ad-hoc_ classification derived from a combination of several factors (purpose, area of operation, vessel size category, gear, gear configuration, fishing mode and target species) that uniquely describe fishing practices for groups of vessels.
          
          An [_interactive wizard_](https://data.iotc.org/fisheries/wizard) to help CPCs identify the IOTC code for  their fisheries (among those currently considered of relevance in the Indian Ocean).
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(FISHERIES, "FISHERIES")
          ```
          
          ### Catch units (FIA.CU) {#catchUnits}
          
          Reference codes that model the units used to report the level of catches / discards of a given species, further stratified by the specific criteria characterizing each reporting form.
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(CATCH_UNITS, "CATCH_UNITS")
          ```
          
          ## Biological and morphometrics domains
          
          ### All species (SPC.ALL) {#allSpecies}
          
          Reference codes modeling the species interacting with the fisheries as:
            
            + target species (retained or discarded)
          + bycatch species (retained or discarded)
          + sampled individuals
          + etc.
          
          These codelists are subsets of the entries in the [ASFIS](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en) list of species for fishery statistics purposes, from which they inherit the alphabetic codes, English, French and scientific names, as well as the family and order, and add the species category (in the IOTC sense), the IUCN status (retrieved from the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org
          ) of endangered species) and other characteristics of each entry such as their status of single species / species aggregate, bait species, SSI species, IOTC species.
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(SPECIES, "SPECIES")
          ```
          
          ### Reasons for discarding (SPC.FTE.DI) {#discardReasons}
          
          Reference codes that model the reasons why aquatic creatures caught by the fishery are then discarded at sea.
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(DISCARD_REASONS, "DISCARD_REASONS")
          ```
          
          ### Individual conditions (SPC.CN) {#individualConditions}
          
          Reference codes modeling the conditions (at capture / at release) of individual aquatic creatures being discarded at sea or measured.
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(INDIVIDUAL_CONDITIONS, "INDIVIDUAL_CONDITIONS")
          ```
          
          ## Data and metadata domains
          
          ### Data types (DTA.TY) {#dataTypes}
          
          Reference codes modeling the type of data provided through a specific form (preliminary / final / unknown).
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(DATA_TYPES, "DATA_TYPES")
          ```

          Reference codes modeling the level of raising applied to the data (raised to totals / not raised to totals / unknown).
          
          ```{r collapse = TRUE}
          out_dt(DATA_RAISINGS, "DATA_RAISINGS")

          ### Discarded catches data sources (DTA.SRC.DI) {#dataSourcesDI}
          
          Reference codes modeling the source of the data provided through the discards data form.

          ### Discarded catches data processings (DTA.PRO.DI) {#dataProcessingsDI}
          
          Reference codes modeling the processing applied to the data provided through the discards data form.
