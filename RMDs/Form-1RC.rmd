# Description

This form provides for the reporting of estimates of retained catches in live weight equivalent (metric tonnes; t) for the IOTC species, common sharks, and other bycatch species. Reporting of quarterly estimates is voluntary and recommended to assess seasonality of the retained catches. For each stratum, the data coverage – i.e., the percentage (%) of amount of fish sampled – derived from the coverage type must be reported to assess the representativeness and quality of the estimates.

# Data content

Total live weight of retained catches by species, along with information on the value (%) and type of sampling coverage used for the estimations by  quarter if available, year, fleet, fishery, retain reason and IOTC main area.
