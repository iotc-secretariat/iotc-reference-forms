# Overview

Following Article XI of the [Agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2012/5/25/IOTC%20Agreement.pdf) (IOTC), [Contracting Parties and Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties](https://iotc.org/about-iotc/structure-commission) (CPCs) are required to collect and report fisheries data in accordance with the [Conservation and Management Measures](https://iotc.org/cmms) (CMMs). To manage the data received from CPCs and other parties fishing in the IOTC area of competence for IOTC-managed species, the Secretariat has developed specific reporting forms for each dataset. The use of these forms for submitting fisheries statistics to the IOTC is highly **recommended**, as they include all mandatory metadata, data fields, and information on IOTC formats and standard codelists.

#### Legacy data reporting forms

The current data reporting forms, referred to as 'legacy,' are available as macro-enabled Microsoft Excel™ spreadsheets. These forms incorporate entry controls and necessary codelists for specific data fields. Guidance on completing these forms is provided in the legacy version of the IOTC Data Reporting Guidelines, accessible [here](./legacy/IOTC_Data_Reporting_Guidelines_2014.pdf).

You can download all the legacy form templates [here](../forms/legacy/IOTC-forms-current.zip). This ZIP archive includes the legacy forms used for the IOTC core fisheries datasets, as well as forms [1IN](#1IN), [3AA](#3AA), and [3DA](#3DA) These forms are tailored to address specific data requirements related to interactions with Endangered, Threatened, and Protected species (1IN), AFAD-related activities (3AA), and DFOB-related activities (3DA).

#### New data reporting forms

New optional data reporting forms are available as plain Microsoft Excel™ spreadsheets to streamline the entry and submission of all necessary information. This format enables reporting officers to input data either manually or programmatically using automated scripts. CPCs are encouraged to familiarise with and test these new forms for reporting data for the statistical year 2023.

You can download all new form templates for submitting the data for the statistical year 2023 [here](../forms/IOTC-forms-new.zip). We welcome your feedback on these new forms and encourage you to direct any questions to the IOTC Secretariat via email at IOTC-Statistics@fao.org.
