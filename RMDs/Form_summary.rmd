# Description

The templates for the submission of fisheries statistics to the IOTC are available as plain Microsoft Excel&trade; spreadsheets to simplify the process of entering and submitting all required information This format allows the reporting officer to enter the data either _directly_ (i.e., by hand) or _programmatically_ (i.e., through automated scripts), for later submission by e-mail or via e-MARIS to the IOTC Secretariat.

# _Default_ forms

## Annual catch data

### Form 1RC{#1RC}

For the submission of estimates of total annual retained catches in live weight stratified by fleet, fishery, main IOTC area, species, and quarter.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form_1RC.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1RC.xlsx)
+ [Interactive form validator](https://data.iotc.org/validators/ui/1RC/)

### Form 1DI{#1DI}

For the submission of estimates of total annual discard levels (either in live-weight equivalent or in numbers) stratified by fleet, fishery, main IOTC area, species, condition at release, and quarter.

#### Resources

For the submission of the matrix of species presence in the catch (retained or discarded) by gear group.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form_1DR.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1DR.xlsx)

### Form 1IN{#1IN}

For the submission of interactions of longline and surface fisheries with endangered, threatened, and protected (ETP) species.

## Catch and effort data

### Form 3CE{#3CE}

For the submission of species-specific catch and fishing effort stratified by fleet, fishery, regular grid or irregular fishing area, effort unit, species, and month. 

This version of the form allows reporting data for multiple fisheries at the same time.

#### Resources

### Form 3AA{#3AA}

For the submission of interactions with anchored fish aggregating devices (aFADs) stratified by fleet, fishery, location of the interaction, type of aFAD and activity, and month.

If the interaction is followed by a set, the resulting catches should also be reported stratified by species, fate, and catch unit. 

This version of the form allows reporting data for multiple fisheries at the same time.

If the interaction is followed by a set, the resulting catches should also be reported stratified by species, fate, and catch unit. 

This version of the form allows reporting data for multiple vessels at the same time.

#### Resources
