# Description

The templates for the submission of fisheries statistics to the IOTC are available as plain Microsoft Excel&trade; spreadsheets to simplify the process of entering and submitting all required information This format allows the reporting officer to enter the data either _directly_ (i.e., by hand) or _programmatically_ (i.e., through automated scripts), for later submission by e-mail or via e-MARIS to the IOTC Secretariat.

# _Default_ forms

## Annual catch data

### Form 1RC{#1RC}

For the submission of estimates of total annual retained catches in live weight stratified by fleet, fishery, main IOTC area, species, and quarter.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-1RC.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1RC.xlsx)

### Form 1DI{#1DI}

For the submission of estimates of total annual discard levels (either in live-weight equivalent or in numbers) stratified by fleet, fishery, main IOTC area, species, condition at release, and quarter.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-1DI.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1DI.xlsx)

### Form 1DR{#1DR}

For the submission of the matrix of species presence in the catch (retained or discarded) by gear group.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-1DR.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1DR.xlsx)

### Form 1IN{#1IN}

For the submission of interactions of longline and surface fisheries with endangered, threatened, and protected (ETP) species.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-1IN.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-1IN.xlsx)

## Active crafts data

### Form 2FC{#2FC}

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-2FC.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-2FC.xlsx)

## Catch and effort data

### Form 3CE{#3CE}

For the submission of species-specific catch and fishing effort stratified by fleet, fishery, regular grid or irregular fishing area, effort unit, species, and month. 

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-3CE.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-3CE.xlsx)

### Form 3CE-multiple{#3CE-multiple}

[Form 3CE](#3CE) is also available in a _multiple_ version to report data for several fisheries at the same time.

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-3CE-multiple.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-3CE-multiple.xlsx)

### Form 3AA{#3AA}

For the submission of interactions with anchored fish aggregating devices (aFADs) stratified by fleet, fishery, location of the interaction, type of aFAD and activity, and month.

If the interaction is followed by a set, the resulting catches should also be reported stratified by species, fate, and catch unit. 

#### Resources

### Form 3DA{#3DA}

For the submission of interactions by purse seine and supply vessels with drifting floating objects (dFOBs, i.e., drifting fish aggregating devices and natural objects) stratified by fleet, vessel, fishery, time and location of the interaction, and type of dFOB.

If the interaction is followed by a set, the resulting catches should also be reported stratified by species, fate, and catch unit. 

#### Resources 

+ [Form description](./Form-3DA.html)
+ [Form template](./Form-3DA.xlsx)

## Socio-economic data

### Form 7PR{#7PR}

[ TBD ]

# _Ad interim_ forms

In order to ensure a smooth transition between the historical data reporting process (which used macro-enabled, self validating Microsoft Excel&trade; spreadsheets) and the [newly proposed IOTC forms](https://iotc.org/documents/WPDCS/19/14), a version of the most common forms has been designed that presents the new form structure while maintaining references to the fishery and target species codes used by the previous IOTC forms.

## Annual catch data

### Form 1RC{#1RC_interim}

A version of [Form 1RC](#1RC) that still uses the _old_ [fishery](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/legacy/#fisheries) and target species / [species](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/legacy/#species) codes.
